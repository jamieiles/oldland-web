Introduction
------------

Oldland is a 32-bit RISC CPU targeted at FPGAs.  The main features are:
![Oldland-core](docs/oldland-core.svg)

  - 5 stage load/store pipeline.
  - 16 general purpose registers.
  - N-way set-associative blocking instruction/data caches
  - Software managed instruction/data TLBs with 4KB page size.
  - JTAG debug controller for execution control and state
  modification/inspection.
  - Exception table for interrupts, data/instruction aborts, illegal
  instruction and software interrupts along with separate ITLB/DTLB miss
  handlers.
  - User and supervisor modes.

Keynsham is a SoC using Oldland as the core and has a number of peripherals:
![Keynsham-soc](docs/keynsham-soc.svg)

 - 32MB SDR SDRAM controller.
 - SPI master with configurable number of chip selects.
 - On-chip bootrom.
 - On-chip memory.
 - Programmable timers.
 - Interrupt controller.
 - UART.
 - SPI master.

There is a C model along with Icarus and Verilator RTL simulations.  The
Keynsham SoC can be synthesized to run on a Terasic DE0 Nano or DE0-CV.  There
are ports of binutils, gcc, newlib, u-boot and RTEMS available.

The Terasic DE0-CV using an Altera Cyclone V and the DE0-nano board using an
Altera Cyclone IV are the supported boards running at ~75MHz on slow silicon
@85Â°C.

Testing
-------

   - Clone [oldland-toolchain](https://github.com/jamieiles/oldland-toolchain)
   and build with:
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/jamieiles/oldland-toolchain.git
cd oldland-toolchain
./build-oldland-elf
. oldland-toolchain-env
{% endhighlight %}

   - Clone [oldland-cpu](https://github.com/jamieiles/oldland-cpu.git) and
   build with:
{% highlight bash %}
git clone https://github.com/jamieiles/oldland-cpu.git
cd oldland-cpu
mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD
cmake -DCMAKE_ISNTALL_PREFIX:PATH=INSTALL_PREFIX ..
make all install
{% endhighlight %}

   - Add `${INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin` to your path.

   - Run `oldland-test` to run the self-tests.

Running On Hardware
-------------------

Build the FPGA image in Quartus and load it onto the device.  Run
oldland-jtagd on the development machine, oldland-debug can then connect to
the CPU over the virtual JTAG.
